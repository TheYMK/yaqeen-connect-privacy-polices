# Privacy Policy

**Yaqeen Connect**

This privacy policy describes how the Yaqeen Connect app collects, uses, and protects your information.

---

## What we collect

We may collect: account information (email, username, profile picture); your approximate or precise location when you use prayer times, Qibla, or the Islamic calendar; device information (model, OS, language, app version); and, when you use the Yaqeen AI recitation feature, your voice recording, which is sent to our servers for AI-based analysis to provide you with recitation feedback.

## Why we collect it

We use this data to provide and personalize the app (e.g. prayer times for your location), to create and manage your account, to process subscriptions through RevenueCat and its payment processors, and to comply with legal obligations. When you use Yaqeen AI, we use your audio solely to generate recitation feedback for you.

## Use of artificial intelligence (Yaqeen AI)

We use artificial intelligence only in the Yaqeen AI recitation feature. When you use it, you record your recitation of a verse; that recording is sent to our systems for AI analysis. The AI evaluates your pronunciation and accuracy and returns feedback such as an overall score, a word-by-word assessment, and suggestions to improve. This is the only use of AI in the app. The feedback results may be stored on your device. We do not use your recordings for any other purpose.

## How long we keep it

We keep your data as long as your account is active and as needed to provide the service. After you delete your account, we remove or anonymize your personal data within a reasonable period, except where we must retain it for legal, tax, or dispute purposes. Voice recordings sent for Yaqeen AI analysis are not retained on our servers after the feedback has been generated.

## Who we share it with

We share data only with RevenueCat and the payment processors it uses (e.g. Apple, Google) to manage subscriptions on iOS and Android. These parties have their own privacy policies and may process data outside your country. We do not use Firebase, Google Analytics, or any other analytics or cloud provider. We do not sell your personal data.

## Your rights

Depending on your place of residence, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data, to object to or restrict certain processing, and to data portability. You can update or delete your account and much of your data from within the app. For other requests, please contact us. You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

## Minors

The app is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not use the app to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 13. The app does not address anyone under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at yaqeenconnect@gmail.com so that we can take the necessary actions.

## Contact
